There are no additions or changes beyond this to the 'Tor Browser' components.

The result is a stand-alone Tor Browser that doesn't start/control a Tor instance. One side effect of this is that
the 'new identify' feature of the TorButton is missing (as there is no control-connection)

The Vuze plugin is responsible for managing the Tor instance lifecycle and setting the browser's SOCKS port configuration appropriately.

The Tor software is free software. This means we give you the rights to redistribute the Tor software, 
either modified or unmodified, either for a fee or gratis. You don't have to ask us for specific permission.

However, if you want to redistribute the Tor software you must follow our LICENSE. Essentially this means that 
you need to include our LICENSE file along with whatever part of the Tor software you're distributing.

Most people who ask us this question don't want to distribute just the Tor software, though. 
They want to distribute the Tor Browser. This includes Mozilla Aurora [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all-aurora.html] 
and Vidalia [https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html.en]. You will need to follow the 
licenses for those programs as well. Both of them are distributed under the GNU General Public License [https://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html]. 
The simplest way to obey their licenses is to include the source code for these programs everywhere you 
include the bundles themselves. Look for "source" packages on the Vidalia page and Mozilla Aurora pages.

The Tor software itself is not included in this plugin, rather it can be found in the 'aznettor' plugin:  

	http://plugins.vuze.com/plugin_details.php?plugin=aznettor

When the above 'distributing tor' link was last consulted it still included references to Vidalia for the 
bundle, which has been removed.

The Mozilla browser is distributed exactly as found in the 'Tor Browser' product with the removals listed above. The sourcecode for this is thus available from the Tor Project.
