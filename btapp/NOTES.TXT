TODOS
=====

- Expand config params plugins can get/set

- api_torrent_file_open needs to prompt user

- the keys() functions need optimizing.  Right now the whole map is generated (with values) and the keys are plucked from it

- most set methods not implemented (only stash.set and events.set implemented)


Differences from BT spec at http://btapps-sdk.bittorrent.com/doc/api.html
====

- All Peer properties are missing explanations in the official spec, so I guessed

- btapp.peer_id returns "VuzeConstantPeerID".  In Vuze, our peer id is unique to the torrent.

- torrent property "progress" has inconsistent definitions in spec. 
  One spec example shows progress from 0 - 1000
  Another spec example shows progress as a percentage float (0.5)
  The intent seems to be 0 - 1000, so we use that
  
- APIs not implemented:
    Torrent.properties.set
    File.get_data
    File.properties.set
    Peer.properties.set
    btapp.add.rss_feed
    btapp.add.rss_filter
    btapp.sendmsg

- Torrent properties not implemented:
   * seed_ratio (no idea what it is)
   * trackers
   * superseed
   * dht
   * pex
   * seed_override (no idea)
   * ulslots
   * rss_feed_url
