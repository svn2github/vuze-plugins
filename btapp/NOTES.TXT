TODOS
=====

- Expand config params plugins can get/set

- api_torrent_file_open needs to prompt user

- the keys() functions need optimizing.  Right now the whole map is generated (with values) and the keys are plucked from it

- most set methods not implemented (only stash.set and events.set implemented)
