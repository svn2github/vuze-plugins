I want to change the colors, how do I make it that the colors match?
Use the HSV model and make sure all colors have the same hue.
As a starting point take the default colors, and change the value for all
to example 120 (green) or 270 (purple)

What are the default values for the colors?
background: #D7EBFF
progress: #80C0FF
text: #004080
border: #004080

Are there other cool combinations?
